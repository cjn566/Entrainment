#Entrainment

Entrainment is the name of an art project that was brought to SOAK in 2016. It is a large semi-toroid structure with a podium in the middle. The podium has two heart rate sensors that two participants would place their finger on to. The structure is reactive to the participants' heartbeats, pulsing strings of LEDs to each beat. When the two heartbeats are sufficiently synchronized, more interesting lighting patterns emerge.
